# Image-Classification-with-Amazon-SageMaker

Train and deploy an image classifier using Amazon Sagemaker. Sagemaker provides a number of machine learning algorithms ready to be used for solving a number of tasks. 
We will use the SageMaker image classification algorithm to create, train and deploy a model that will be able to classify 37 breeds of dogs and cats from the popular IIIT-Oxford Pets Dataset.
